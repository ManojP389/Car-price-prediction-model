# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction Model

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of a car based on various features such as brand, year, engine size, mileage, fuel type, and more. It is part of my internship project to demonstrate skills in data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

##  Project Objective

To develop an accurate and reliable regression model that can predict the resale value of cars using historical data.

##  Technologies Used

- Python 
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
--

##  Steps Involved

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Dataset used: [e.g., Kaggle Car Dataset or custom dataset]

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling (if required)
   - Train-test split

3. **Model Building**
   - Linear Regression


4. **Model Evaluation**
   - RÂ² Score

5. **Model Selection**
   - Based on best evaluation metrics and performance

##  Results

- Best RÂ² Score: `0.XX` (e.g., 0.49)
- Features with highest influence: `Year`, `Mileage`, `Brand`, `Fuel Type`
